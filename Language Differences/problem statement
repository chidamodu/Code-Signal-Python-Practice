Your friend, an experienced coder, has just started to learn Python. Since he is already proficient in Java and C++, 
he decided to write all his snippets in all three languages to test his Python code. Here's the very first function 
your friend wrote in Python and Java (the C++ version is the same as Java one):

def division(x, y):
    return x // y
in division(int x, int y) {
    return x / y;
}

You noticed that the functions aren't quite the same: they won't produce the same result for some valid values of x 
and y. Which ones?

a. x = 15, y = -4
b. x = -8, y = 2
c. x = -8, y = 2
d. x = 17, y = 13
e. x = 5, y = 10
